<h1><tt>ostream_joiner</tt></h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
This paper updates the <tt>ostream_joiner</tt> proposal to reflect experience
    in Library Fundamentals V2 and changes in the core language since then.
    Specifically, we add a deduction guide to ensure that <tt>ostream_joiner</tt>
    is constructed correctly from a C string literal. Secondly, we were able to take
    advantage of the library fundamentals process to identify
    three enhancements based on experience.
    <ul><li>Replacing <tt>make_ostream_joiner</tt> with a deduction guide</li>
    <li>Allowing the placement of the delimiter to be 
    specified in accordance to support some common uses cases</li>
    <li>We add a &ldquo;counting&rdquo; I/O manipulator that makes it
        easy to support the common use case of generating numbered lists.
<blockquote><pre>Fritos Ingredients:
    1. Corn
    2. Corn oil
    3. Salt</pre></blockquote></li>
    <li>Allowing the initial, infix, and suffix initializers to be different,
        as this allows programming in a more functional/STL/ranges style
        in what we have found to be the most common use case in our programming:
<blockquote><pre>(1, 2, 3, 4)</pre></blockquote></li></ul>
All of the above changes are implemented and exercised on <a href="https://wandbox.org/permlink/RGHtkCqVZeCF7Qb2">Wandbox</a>.
We leave ship vehicle to the committee
<h2>Deduction guides</h2>
With the addition of class template argument deduction in C++17, it seems desirable
to get rid of the clumsy <tt>make_ostream_joiner</tt> as we did with class templates
    like <tt>boyer_moore_searcher</tt>. However, as Nathan Myers has pointed out,
    without any deduction guide, the decision to take the delimiter by reference
    means that<code>ostream_joiner j(cout, ", ");</code>
    produces a compile time error as the delimiter type is deduced as <tt>char const[3]</tt>.
    To fix this, add the following to the end of the class definition for ostream_joiner
<h3>Wording</h3>
<blockquote><pre>};

<span class="ins">template&lt;class DelimT, class CharT, class Traits&gt;
ostream_joiner(std::basic_ostream&lt;CharT, Traits&gt;, _Delim) -&gt; ostream_joiner&lt;Delim, CharT, Traits&gt;;</span></pre></blockquote>
<h3>Process</h3>
We feel this change is certainly compatible with moving <tt>ostream_joiner</tt> into C++20.
However, we note that doing so without the other changes may create ABI challenges for
adding the exgtensions proposed in this paper below.
<h2>Delimiter type</h2>
It is already somewhat odd to have to use <tt>ostream_iterator</tt> whan a suffix delimiter
is desired but <tt>ostream_joiner</tt> when an infix iterator is desired. Furthermore,
our experience exercising this in practice is that we also often find ourselves wanting
a prefix delimiter, which is not directly supported with either class, to generate output like the following:
<blockquote><pre>Fritos Ingredients:
    * Corn
    * Corn oil
    * Salt</pre></blockquote>
We therefore propose allowing a consistent approach to all these cases by
    adding an additional  parameter of type
<code>enum class delimiter { prefix, infix, suffix, all };</code>
that defaults to <tt>delimiter::infix</tt>, so there is no source breakage to 
usage of <tt>ostream_joiner</tt>. In particular, the above list can
    be easily generated with
<code>copy(ingredients.begin(), ingredients.end(), ostream_joiner(cout, "\\n* ", delimiter::prefix));</code>
We have also found that it is very common to output numbered lists (indeed, unnumbered and
    numbered lists are given equal prominence in Word, HTML, etc.), which
is easy with a counting IO manipulator which generates the numbered ingredient list
at the top of the page.
<code>copy(ingredients.begin(), ingredients.end(), ostream_joiner(cout, counter(1), delimiter::prefix));</code>
We also propose a  <tt>counter</tt> (bikeshed) class template with the following declaration, where the contained value is
iterated on each insertion (preceded by the <tt>before</tt> and followed by the <tt>after</tt>)
<code>template&lt;class before, class after&gt;
struct counter {
  counter(int value = 0, before b = "\n", after e = ". ");
  <span class="comment">/* ... */</span>
};</code>
<h2>Multiple delimiters</h2>
As we have found that we most commonly want print different delimiters before and after a list, we
    always find it clumsy, and a break from our preferred STL/functional/range-inspired style
    to invariably have to write code like:
<code>// Surprisingly hard to print (a, b, c)
cout  &lt;&lt;  "(";
copy(v.begin(), v.end(), ostream_joiner(cout, ", "));
cout &lt;&lt; ")";
</code>
just to print <tt>(a, b, c)</tt>. Indeed, in any engineering or graphics code where points
or vectors are commonly being printed, it is easy to imagine this tripling the size of the
logging code!
<p>To handle this, we also allow three delimiters to be passed into the constructor as
    follows</p><code>// Now prints (a, b, c) directly
copy(v.begin(), v.end(), ostream_joiner(cout, "(", ", ", ")");
</code>
This is accomplished with an additional constructor as follows:

<code>template&lt;typename DelimT, typename charT, typename traits, typename CloseT = <span class="comment"><em>implementation-defined</em></span>&gt;
class ostream_joiner { 
public:
    <span class="comment">/* ... */</span>
    template&lt;typename OpenT&gt;
    ostream_joiner(ostream_type &amp;os, OpenT open, DelimT del, CloseT);
    <span class="comment">/* ... */</span>
</code>
Note the following:
<ul><li>There is no need for a <tt>delimiter</tt> flag because each type of delimiter is
    passed in the constructor</li>
    <li>There are no concerns about ambiguities in overload resolution as it is the only four argument constructor.</li>
    <li>The open delimiter type is not part of the class template parameters
    because it is output on construction and then discarded.</li>
<li>To apply the copy/move paradigm that we currently are, there would
be eight variants of the above constructor taking both const and rvalue
references independently for each parameter. We are not opposed to that,
but did not show it above for clarity of presentation.</li>
<li>To make this work, only the original <tt>ostream_joiner</tt> prints
the closing delimiter when it is destroyed, so copies made in STL algorithms
do not prematurely close the list. Although this makes <tt>ostream_joiner</tt>
no longer be a <tt>Regular</tt> type, we feel that is ok because not
all types need to be regular. In particular, we have find this to be natural
and easy-to-use in practice as shown above and in additional examples shown on
    <a href="https://wandbox.org/permlink/RGHtkCqVZeCF7Qb2">wandbox</a>,
    not unlike scoped locks.</li>
<li>If it is desired to output the closing delimiter before the end of scope, we  provide
a <tt>complete()</tt> method for that purpose. We did not provide a <tt>release()</tt> method
due to lack of use cases but could easily do so if desired.</li>
</ul>
